# badger-thermoclines
This respository was created as part of a final project for ENVIRON 872 at Duke University. I am looking at NTLR data to determine thermocline movement on 9 Wisconsin lakes between the period 1984 and 2016. There are potentially biological ramifications from a shrinking coldwater summer refuge for organisms such as trout if in fact thermoclines are setting up at lower levels.

## Summary
The dataset used for this project was prepared for Environmental Data Analytics (ENV 872L) at Duke University, Spring 2019 by Kateri Salk.

The following information on the data was prepared by Professor Salk:

"The dataset contains data from studies on several lakes in the North Temperate Lakes District in Wisconsin, USA. Data were collected as part of the Long Term Ecological Research station established by the National Science Foundation."

## Database Information
The following information on the data was prepared by Professor Salk:

"Data were collected from the North Temperate Lakes Long Term Ecological Research website. More information can be found here: https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/about/overview

Data were collected using the Data tool (https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/data).
From the Data homepage, the following selections were made: 
* Cascade (NTL Categories)
* Cascade Project at North Temperate Lakes LTER Core Data Carbon 1984 - 2016

AND

* Cascade Project at North Temperate Lakes LTER Core Data Nutrients 1991 - 2016

AND

* Cascade Project at North Temperate Lakes LTER Core Data Physical and Chemical Limnology 1984 - 2016
* On each of the three pages, Download All Data (csv) was chosen.
Data were accessed 2018-12-06."

### Physical and chemical limnology

The following information on the data was prepared by Professor Salk:

"Physical and chemical variables are measured at one central station near the deepest point of each lake. In most cases these measurements are made in the morning (0800 to 0900). Vertical profiles are taken at varied depth intervals. Chemical measurements are sometimes made in a pooled mixed layer sample (PML); sometimes in the epilimnion, metalimnion, and hypolimnion; and sometimes in vertical profiles. In the latter case, depths for sampling usually correspond to the surface plus depths of 50percent, 25percent, 10percent, 5percent and 1percent of surface irradiance.

Methods for 1984-1990 were described by Carpenter and Kitchell (1993) and methods for 1991-1997 were described by Carpenter et al. (2001).
