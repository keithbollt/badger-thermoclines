# badger-thermoclines
This respository was created as part of a final project for ENVIRON 872 at Duke University. I am looking at NTLR data to determine thermocline movement on 9 Wisconsin lakes between the period 1984 and 2016. There are potentially biological ramifications from a shrinking coldwater summer refuge for organisms such as trout if in fact thermoclines are setting up at lower levels.

## Summary
The dataset used for this project was prepared for Environmental Data Analytics (ENV 872L) at Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment for the spring 2019 semester by Kateri Salk.

The dataset contains physical and chemical data from nine lakes in Wisconsin. The data was collected between 1984 and 2016 as part of the NSF-funded North Temperate Lakes Long Term Ecological Research Station.

### Physical and chemical limnology

The following information on the data was prepared by Professor Salk:

The data is measured at a station in the middle of each of the nine lakes. Generally, the data was collected in the morning. The data is taken at increments, and most data is taken at or below ten meters depth. The temporal resolution varies across lakes. Some lakes only have a few years of data, while others have ample data from most or all years. The data was taken during periods of no ice on the lake. This means that there is little data during the winter months. While there are several different measurements taken at these lakes, the two variables that the thermocline study focuses on are dissolved oxygen and temperature.

Data collection techniques used during the period 1984-1990 were described by Carpenter and Kitchell (1993) and data collection techniques for 1991-1997 were described by Carpenter et al. (2001).
